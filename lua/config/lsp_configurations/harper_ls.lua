-- `harper_ls.lua`: LSP configurations for Harper, a spelling and grammar checker.

--- Harper is necessarily pretty aggressive, this returns a callback to toggle it when it gets too
--- loud.
---
--- It will detach and reattach Harper (or any other given LSP client) from the given buffer, with
--- the intention of disabling their diagnostics.
---
--- @param client vim.lsp.Client The LSP client being toggled.
--- @param buffnr integer The buffer to attach and detach the client from.
--- @return fun() callback The callback that actually toggles the client.
